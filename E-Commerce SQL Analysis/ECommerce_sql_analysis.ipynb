Frankly, States like Acre (AC) and Rondonia (RO) show higher CRRs but it may be influenced by comparatively low number of orders in these states (small samples can lead to more significant fluctuations). But big states such as Sao Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) have slightly lower CRRs, possibly due to a bigger sample size or more competitive market/diverse consumer options. In general, the majority of states show relatively stable CRR around **6%**, indicating a moderate level of customer retention.

    "The summary of the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Order Trends Over Time**: Olist had a steady growth in revenue, especially notable in 2018. November 2017 had the highest monthly revenue, likely influenced by Black Friday sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average Order Value (AOV)**: The AOV varies across product categories, with technology, appliances, and safety categories demonstrating high performance. Payment method analysis indicates that credit card users have the highest AOV, while voucher payments show the lowest, suggesting varying customer spending behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seller Dynamics**: Olist had a total of 3,095 sellers, with a growing number of active sellers over time. This indicates a positive trend in seller engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Order Cancellation Rate**: The order cancellation rate is low at 0.63%, suggesting Olist's effective order management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer Re-Purchases**: Out of 90,096 customers, 2,924 made repeat purchases, contributing 5.6% to the total revenue. While returned customers are valuable, they don't dominate the revenue stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Product Popularity and Ratings**: Popular products often have an average review score around 4.0, highlighting the challenge of balancing sales volume and high ratings.
